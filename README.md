Cryptocurrency data analysis and prediction  for short term investment. Data Science Project for MTech Artificial Intelligence course at University of Hyderabad.

There are well over a thousand cryptocurrencies in existence today. Investing in cryptocurrencies can lead to substantial profits or crippling losses for the investor. Out of these currencies, which one is the best to invest in? What are the trends in the major cryptocurrencies that can be made visible to the investor? These are the questions that will be answered in the project by using a dataset that logged the major cryptocurrencies throughout these last few years. After the descriptive data analysis, we will try to predict the future values of the major cryptocurrencies using predictive analytics techniques using machine learning to find out if it is possible to make the most optimal investment. This project will try to check if machine learning can predict the future of the ever unpredictable blockchain.

NOTE: Project is not complete.
